            android:text=" is a song by American rapper Pitbull featuring American recording artist Kesha. The song was released on October 7, 2013, as the lead single from Pitbull's extended play (EP) Meltdown. The song was produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Sermstyle, with additional production by Nick Seeley.[2][3] The song interpolates Lee Oskar's 1978 single San Francisco Bay and features harmonica player Paul Harrington, who plays through the entire song and was told to emulate Oskar.[4]

The song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks and also topped the charts in many other countries, including Canada (where it stood at No. 1 for eight consecutive weeks), Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. According to the IFPI, the song sold 12.6 million units worldwide in 2014, including single-track downloads and track-equivalent streams, becoming the sixth best-selling song of that year."
